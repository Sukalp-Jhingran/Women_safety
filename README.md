# Women_safety
I have created a comprehensive Women Safety Analytics dashboard using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. 

Here's an overview of the implementation:
App.tsx: The main component that structures the entire application. It includes the Header, Dashboard, and Footer components.
Header.tsx: A responsive header with the application logo and navigation menu.
Dashboard.tsx: The core component that displays the key features of the Women Safety Analytics system. It includes:

Feature cards for each main functionality
A bar chart showing incident hotspots using the Recharts library
Footer.tsx: A simple footer component with copyright information.

The dashboard showcases the following features:
-> Gender Distribution
-> Lone Woman Detection
-> Surrounding Analysis
-> SOS Detection
-> Hotspot Identification
-> Trend Analysis

The design is modern, clean, and user-friendly, using a color scheme dominated by indigo and white to convey trust and professionalism. 
The layout is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes.

To further enhance this application, you could:
1. Implement real-time data fetching from a backend API.
2. Add more detailed views for each feature, such as a map view for hotspots.
3. Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
4. Add real-time alerts and notifications for detected incidents.
5. Integrate with a machine learning model for improved threat detection.
